I have extracted a set of variables from a paper. For each variable, I have given it a unique ID, a name, and a short description.
I also have the schemas of a few datasets that I found online.
I want to find the columns in the datasets that match the variables I have extracted.

The variables I have extracted are as follows:
```txt
[DESC]
```

The datasets and their schemas (given as a comma-separated list of column names) are as follows:
```txt
[DATASET]
```

Please help me find the columns in the datasets that match the variables I have extracted.
For each variable, print the variable id and up to two column names that match it, as well as the dataset that the column belongs to.
Separate dataset names and column names with a colon (:), and separate column names with a comma (,).
If there is no match for a variable, print "None" instead of the column names.

Give your answer in a ``` block with the following format:
```
<variable id>: <dataset:column name 1>, <dataset:column name 2>
<variable id>: <dataset:column name 1>, <dataset:column name 2>
<variable id>: <dataset:column name 1>, <dataset:column name 2>
...
```
Make sure that the output matches the format exactly, including being surrounded by three backticks (```) on the top and bottom.
