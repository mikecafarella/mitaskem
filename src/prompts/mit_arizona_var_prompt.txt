I used two systems, System A and System B, to extract variables from a paper.
Each variable has a unique ID, a name, and optionally a description (which may be empty).
These are given in the following format:
```
<id>, <name>: <description>
```

The two systems have different performance, so I want to merge the results from the two systems to get the best final result possible.
That is, I want to find the best possible match between the variables from System A and the variables from System B, based on the variable names and descriptions.

System A gave the following output:
```
[MIT]
```

System B gave the following output:
```
[ARIZONA]
```

Please help me find the best possible match between the outputs of System A and System B.
The output should only contain the IDs of the variables which are matched between the two systems.
Give your answer in the following format:
```
<id from system A>: <id from system B>
<id from system A>: <id from system B>
...
```
Make sure each item is on its own line, and that the IDs are separated from the names by a colon and a space (`: `).
Make sure that the output matches the format exactly, including being surrounded by three backticks (```) on the top and bottom.
