I have a dataset (as a CSV file) as well as a textual description of the contents of the dataset.
I need to extract some metadata from the dataset and the textual description.

The metadata to be extracted is as follows:
```txt
[FIELDS]
```

The dataset is as follows:
```csv
[CSV]
```

The textual description is as follows:
```txt
[DOC]
```

Please help me extract the metadata from the dataset and the textual description.
Print the result in the following format:
```
<field name>: <field value>
<field name>: <field value>
<field name>: <field value>
...
```
Only print metadata that can be extracted from the dataset and the textual description.
If the metadata cannot be extracted, please print "UNKNOWN" instead of the field value.
