The estimated basic reproduction number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 2.0 to 3.511\u201313, which seems comparable, or possibly higher, than for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were found in upper respiratory specimens of patients showing little or no symptoms, with a viral shedding pat- tern akin to that of influenza viruses14. Hence, inapparent transmis- sion may play a major and underestimated role in sustaining the outbreak. Predictive  mathematical  models  for  epidemics15\u201318  are  fun- damental  to  understand  the  course  of  the  epidemic  and  to  plan effective control strategies. One commonly used model is the SIR model19  for  human-to-human  transmission,  which  describes  the flow of individuals through three mutually exclusive stages of infec- tion: susceptible, infected and recovered. More complex models can accurately  portray  the  dynamic  spread  of  specific  epidemics.  For the COVID-19 pandemic, several models have been developed. Lin and colleagues extended a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed)  model  considering  risk  perception  and  the  cumulative number  of  cases20,  Anastassopoulou  and  colleagues  proposed  a discrete-time SIR model including dead individuals21, Casella devel- oped a control-oriented SIR model that stresses the effects of delays and compares the outcomes of different containment policies22 and Wu and colleagues used transmission dynamics to estimate the clin- ical severity of COVID-1923. Stochastic transmission models have also been considered24,25. Here, we propose a new mean-field epide- miological model for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy that extends the classical SIR model, similar to that developed by Gumel and col- leagues for SARS26. A summary of the main findings, limitations and implications of the model for policymakers is shown in Table 1.",

We have proposed a new model that predicts the evolution of epidemics and helps to assess the impact of different strategies to contain the spread of the infection, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracing. Testing is important because undetected infected people, most of whom are asymptomatic, largely sustain the epidemic spread. Main findings and Several possible scenarios have been outlined. Under the less stringent lockdown conditions with limited testing, we predict that limitations more than 70,000 people could die in Italy in the first year. However, if strict lockdown measures continue to be maintained and population-wide testing and contact tracing efforts are substantially increased, the number of deaths could potentially be limited to 25,000 people overall. As with all modeling studies, our predictions are based on reasonable assumptions, but the actual course of the epidemic heavily relies on how and when isolation and safety measures are implemented. Policy implications Our findings confirm that the adopted social-distancing measures are necessary and effective, and should be promptly enforced at the earliest stage. Lockdown measures can only be relieved safely in the presence of widespread testing and contact tracing. Combining lockdown and population-wide testing is key to rapidly ending the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "content": "Extended Data Fig. 1 shows how the situation could have evolved if milder or stronger measures had been implemented earlier. The curve following day 22 shows the importance and effectiveness of a prompt lockdown. The actual epidemic evolution corresponds to an intermediate scenario: the lockdown measures had a moderate effect, probably due to their incremental nature. We predict a range of possible future scenarios, with different measures enforced after day 50. Figure 3a,b shows, if the lockdown is weakened, a sudden and strong  increase  of  the  spread  of  disease,  a  prolonged  emergency and more deaths (0.12% of the population in the first 350 days). Figure 3c,d shows the benefits of stricter lockdown measures: after 350 days, 0.41% of the population would contract the virus (0.30% diagnosed) and 0.04% of the population would die. A policy of population-wide testing and contact tracing would help  to  rapidly  end  the  epidemic,  as  suggested  by  Peto28.  Figure 4a,b shows the effect of such measures: the peak would be reached sooner  and,  after  350  days,  0.43%  of  the  population  would  con- tract the virus (0.33% diagnosed), with an estimated 0.05% dying. Figure 4c,d shows the effect of combining a milder lockdown with widespread testing and contact tracing: after 350 days, 0.52% of the population would contract the virus (0.41% diagnosed) and 0.05% would die.",

The interactions among different stages of infection are visually represented in the graphical scheme in Fig. 1. The parameters are defined as follows: \u2022 \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 respectively denote the transmission rate (the probability of disease transmission in a single contact multiplied by the average number of contacts per person) due to contacts between a susceptible subject and an infected, a diagnosed, an ailing or a recognized subject. Typically, \u03b1 is larger than \u03b3 (assuming that people tend to avoid contacts with subjects showing symptoms, even though diagnosis has not been made yet), which in turn is larger than \u03b2 and \u03b4 (assuming that subjects who have been diagnosed are properly isolated). These parameters can be modified by social-distancing policies (for example, closing schools, remote working, lockdown). The risk of contagion due to threatened subjects, treated in proper ICUs, is assumed negligible. \u2022 \u03b5 and \u03b8 capture the probability rate of detection, relative to asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. These parameters, also modifiable, reflect the level of attention on the disease and the number of tests performed over the population: they can be increased by enforcing a massive contact tracing and testing campaign28. Note that \u03b8 is typically larger than \u03b5, as a symptomatic individual is more likely to be tested. \u2022 \u03b6 and \u03b7 denote the probability rate at which an infected subject, respectively not aware and aware of being infected, develops clinically relevant symptoms, and are comparable in the absence of specific treatment. These parameters are disease-dependent, but may be partially reduced by improved therapies and acquisition of immunity against the virus. \u2022 \u00b5 and \u03bd respectively denote the rate at which undetected and detected infected subjects develop life-threatening symptoms; they are comparable if there is no known specific treatment that is effective against the disease, otherwise \u00b5 may be larger. Conversely, \u03bd may be larger because infected individuals with more acute symptoms, who have a higher risk of worsening, are more likely to have been diagnosed. These parameters can be reduced by means of improved therapies and acquisition of immunity against the virus. \u2022 \u03c4 denotes the mortality rate (for infected subjects with life-threatening symp- toms) and can be reduced by means of improved therapies. \u2022 \u03bb, \u03ba, \u03be, \u03c1 and \u03c3 denote the rate of recovery for the five classes of infected sub- jects; they may differ significantly if an appropriate treatment for the disease is known and adopted for diagnosed patients, but are probably comparable otherwise. These parameters can be increased thanks to improved treatments and acquisition of immunity against the virus.",

In the model, we omit the probability rate of becoming susceptible again, after having already recovered from the infection, because this appears to be negligible based on early evidence27. Given the scarcity of available data, it is impossible to have conclusive evidence about immunity at this stage. Immunity might also be temporary38. Although some reports suggest the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection27,39,40, the indicated presence of viral RNA in respiratory samples might reflect a persistence rather than a true recurrence. The literature on the recrudescence of related members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, is similarly sporadic. MERS-CoV reinfection despite serum detection of neutralizing antibodies has been described",

        "content": "only in animals41,42, while the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum via primary infection or passive transfer has been shown to prevent respiratory tract replication of SARS-CoV in a murine model43. From a modeling perspective, we are particularly interested in predictions over a relatively short horizon within which the temporary immunity is likely still to be in place, and the possibility of reinfection would negligibly affect the total number of susceptible individuals and so there would be no substantial difference in the evolution of the epidemic curves we consider. To provide solid support to this claim, Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the results of numerical simulation of the model when the possibility of reinfection is introduced: the evolution is almost identical, with the only difference being that the recovered population of course decreases over time. Hence, based on the evidence at hand, although we cannot rule out that adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may not provide long-lasting protection, we may reasonably consider the probability of reinfection to be negligible within the scope of our model. Also, our model accounts for a distinction between non-diagnosed individuals, who spread the infection more because they are not in isolation, and diagnosed individuals, who transmit the disease much less thanks to proper isolation and complying with strict rules, either in hospital or at home. Because Italy is on lockdown, extended emergency measures nationwide are being applied to contain the epidemic: unless indispensable for fundamental activities, people are forced to stay at home in family settings, drastically reducing the risk of spreading the disease. Person-to-person household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been described in China44,45. Although the infection of household members of COVID- 19-positive individuals is possible, the rate of this occurrence is difficult to estimate so far. The only way to completely avoid such risk is to separate infected individuals in dedicated quarantine centers46, as has been done partially in Italy, confining infected people in individual hotel rooms. Even with reduced admissions to hospital, patients that are treated at home and assisted by household members strictly comply with the home isolation guidelines issued by experts47, ranging from sanitary hygiene measures (including waste management, cleaning of contaminated surfaces and household laundering) to interhuman contact measures among family members (the caregiver of a suspected or confirmed COVID- 19-infected individual in home isolation must be in good health and maintain a distance of at least 1 m, avoiding direct contact with oral or respiratory secretions, faeces and urine; moreover, a surgical mask and disposable gloves should always be used). Hence, we can safely assume that in-house transmission is severely limited. Although we do consider a delay in the emergence of symptoms, through asymptomatic (or pauci-symptomatic) patients, categorized as undetected (infected) and detected (diagnosed), our model does not account for a possible latency between exposure to the virus and onset of infectiousness, because there is mounting evidence that an infected individual can transmit the virus at an early, preclinical stage of the disease, based on epidemiological investigation of COVID-19 clusters45,48\u201350. Moreover, recent studies estimated median serial interval values for COVID-19 to be close to or shorter than the median incubation period51,52, further proving the possibility of presymptomatic transmission of the disease. For this reason, we deemed it unnecessary to include an additional stage: although asymptomatic, individuals exposed to the virus retain a potential of viral transmission and thus reasonably fit within the infected and diagnosed stages. Finally, the SIDARTHE model is a mean-field type of model, where the average effect of phenomena involving the whole population is captured. Social mixing patterns are incorporated into our contagion parameters in an averaged fashion over the whole population, irrespective of age. However, our model is fully flexible and suited to include, for example, a distinction between age classes, which would require splitting each variable of the model into N variables if N age classes are considered. Another possible future development is to extend the model to predict the simultaneous evolution of other diseases, which, due to the epidemic emergency, may be overestimated, underestimated or not treated appropriately because the healthcare system is overloaded, thus leading to an increased number of \u2018collateral\u2019 deaths not directly linked to the virus.",

So only the susceptible, the healed and the deceased with \u0016S \u00fe \u0016H \u00fe \u0016E \u00bc 1 I populations are eventually present, meaning that the epidemic phenomenon , with is over. All the possible equilibria are given by  \u0016S; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; \u0016H; \u0016E \u00f0 \u00de I . \u0016S \u00fe \u0016H \u00fe \u0016E \u00bc 1 I To understand the system behavior, we partition it into three subsystems: the first includes just variable S (corresponding to susceptible individuals), the second includes I, D, A, R and T (the infected individuals), which are non-zero only during the transient, and the third includes variables H and E (representing healed and defunct). We focus on the second subsystem, which we denote the IDART subsystem. An important observation is that when (and only when) the infected individuals I + D + A + R + T are zero are the remaining variables S, H and E at equilibrium. Variables H and E (which are monotonically increasing) converge to their asymptotic values  \u0016H and \u0016E, and S (which is monotonically decreasing) converges to \u0016S if and only if I, D, A, R and T converge to zero. The overall system can be recast in a feedback structure, where the IDART subsystem can be seen as a positive linear system subject to a feedback signal u as follows. Defining x = [I D A R T]\u22a4, we can rewrite the IDART subsystem as 1 0 0 0 0 \ufffdr1 \u03b5 0 0 0 0 \ufffdr2 \u03b6 0 0 0 u\u00f0t\u00de \u00f09\u00de x t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe _x t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Fx t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe bu t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0 \ufffdr3 \u03b7 \u03b8 0 0 0 \ufffdr4 \u03bc \u03bd 0 0 0 \ufffdr5 37777775 26666664 37777775 26666664",

Because the system is positive, the H\u221e norm of G(s) is equal to the static gain G(0) = N(0)/D(0). Then, by standard root locus (small gain argument) on the positive system G(s), we can say that the polynomial is Hurwitz (all roots in the left-hand plane) if , which proves the result. and only if expression (17) holds, where \u0016S* \u00bc 1=G 0\u00f0 \u00de I We observe that, therefore, we are well justified to define the basic reproduction parameter 1 \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b2\u03b5=r2 \u00fe \u03b3\u03b6=r3 \u00fe \u03b4 \u03b7\u03b5= r2r4 \u00f0 \u00f0 \u00de \u00fe \u03b6\u03b8= r3r4 \u00f0 \u00de \u00de R0 :\u00bc \ue016S* \u00bc r1 and stability of the equilibrium occurs for \u0016SR0 <1 . I (Notice also that R0 = G(0) is the H\u221e norm of the transfer function G(s).) QED The threshold \u0016S* is of fundamental importance. Because, asymptotically, I S(t) converges monotonically to a constant \u0016S, such a constant \u0016S must ensure convergence of the IDART subsystem to zero (hence stability; otherwise, S could not converge to \u0016S). Therefore, we have the following result. cannot Proposition 2. For positive initial conditions, the limit value \u0016S \u00bc lim S\u00f0t\u00de t!1 exceed \u0016S* . I I Proof of proposition 2. Because S(t) is monotonically decreasing and non-negative, . Then the system it has a limit \u0016S\u22650 . For t large enough, we have S t\u00f0 \u00de \ue019 \u0016S I I converges to the linear system corresponding to the linearization in \u0016S. If, by contradiction, \u0016S renders this system unstable, then x(t) diverges, as the Metzler has a positive dominant eigenvalue. In turn, this implies that matrix F \u00fe b\u0016Sc> I x(t) cannot converge to zero, hence its components remain positive, which means that \u03b1I + \u03b2D + \u03b3A + \u03b4R > 0 does not converge to zero. As a consequence, also does not converge to zero, hence S(t) cannot _S \u00bc \ufffdS \u03b1I \u00fe \u03b2D \u00fe \u03b3A \u00fe \u03b4R \u00f0 \u00de <0 I converge to a non-negative value \u0016S\u22650 . We have reached a contradiction. QED I The threshold value of expression (17) has a deep meaning. The limit \u0016S represents the fraction of population that has never been infected. This value is a decreasing function of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4, which are the infection parameters.

To preserve the stability of the IDART subsystem and ensure that the equilibrium \u0016S is reached, either the infection coefficients are small or the final value \u0016S is small. Defining the basic reproduction number as \u03b1 \u03b2\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b6 \u03b4\u03b7\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b6\u03b8 1 R0 :\u00bc \ue016S* \u00bc \u00f018\u00de r1 \u00fe r1r2 \u00fe r1r3 \u00fe r1r2r4 \u00fe r1r3r4 we have that stability of the equilibrium occurs for \u0016SR0 <1 \u00f019\u00de , so that stability occurs for At the outset of the epidemic we have \u0016S \u2019 1 I R0 <1 which essentially represents an immediate recovery with no large involvement of the population. Larger values of R0 imply a strong affection of the population according to equation (19). We can provide an important formula that relates the coefficient R0 with the steady-state value \u0016S (and  \u0016H, \u0016E). , Proposition 3.

It is important to stress that equation (23) could be totally misleading for a long-term prediction, because in the long run the coefficients of matrix F are going the sum of the squares of the errors. The model involves many state variables, as to change. So, if there is a change in the parameters at time t0, for example due well as a large number of uncertain parameters whose numerical determination to imposed restrictions and countermeasures, the prediction has to be adjusted is a very challenging problem; it is likely that an infinite number of different by considering f0 = \u2212c\u22a4F\u22121x(t0), where F includes the new parameter values and parameter sets could be found, matching the data equally well.

Data about the number of deaths (corresponding to E(t) in our model) appear particularly high with respect to the CFR reported in the literature; this can be largely explained by the age structure of the Italian population, which is the second oldest in the world (the reported CFR across all countries increases steeply with the age of the patient), and by the extensive intergenerational contacts in Italian society, which enhanced the spreading of the virus among older and more fragile generations54. Perhaps more importantly, it can also be explained by the Italian criteria for (provisional) statistics, which lead to overestimation. In fact, unlike other countries, the official numbers for COVID-19 deaths provisionally include the deaths of all people tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even when they had multiple pre-existing life-threatening diseases and the exact cause of death had not yet been ascertained, so these numbers still need to be confirmed55. Thus, an important challenge in tuning the model is that the initial data are affected by statistical distortion: in particular, the values of the ratio death/infected are highly overestimated. The model fitting process must take this problem into account. Therefore, we decided to fit the parameters based on the data about the diagnosed infected population and the number of recovered diagnosed patients, but not on the data about deaths. It is also worth stressing that, in the long run, the model is weakly sensitive to the initial conditions; for this reason, the initial mismatch concerning the mortality data has little impact. We adopt a best-fit approach to find the parameters that locally minimize the sum of the squares of the errors. The model involves many state variables, as well as a large number of uncertain parameters whose numerical determination is a very challenging problem; it is likely that an infinite number of different parameter sets could be found, matching the data equally well. On the other hand, our parameters are control tuning knobs whose values should realistically reproduce the data and the reproduction number R0 in plausible scenarios. Relying on a\u00a0priori epidemiological and clinical information about the relative parameter magnitude (as discussed above), and starting from a random initial guess, the model parameters have been fitted by reiterated local minimization of the sum of the squares of the errors. During the course of the simulation, the parameters have been updated based on the successive measures, of increasing strength, adopted by policymakers. In particular, the fraction of the population in each stage at day 1 is set as: I = 200/60e6, D = 20/60e6, A = 1/60e6, R = 2/60e6, T = 0, H = 0, E = 0; S = 1 \u2013 I \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 R \u2013 T \u2013 H \u2013 E. The parameters are set as \u03b1 = 0.570, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.011, \u03b3 = 0.456, \u03b5 = 0.171, \u03b8 = 0.371, \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.125, \u03bc = 0.017, \u03bd = 0.027, \u03c4 = 0.01, \u03bb = \u03c1 = 0.034 and \u03ba = \u03be = \u03c3 = 0.017. The resulting basic reproduction number is R0 = 2.38. After day 4, as a consequence of basic social-distancing measures due to the public being aware of the epidemic outbreak and due to recommendations (such as washing hands often, not touching one\u2019s face, avoiding handshakes and keeping distance) and early measures (such as closing schools) by the Italian government, we set \u03b1 = 0.422, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.0057 and \u03b3 = 0.285, so the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.66. Also, after day 12, we set \u03b5 = 0.143 as a consequence of the policy limiting screening to symptomatic individuals only; thus, totally asymptomatic individuals are almost no longer detected, while individuals with very mild symptoms are still detected (hence \u03b5 is not set exactly to zero). Due to this, R0 = 1.80. After day 22, the lockdown, at first incomplete, yields \u03b1 = 0.360, \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 0.005 and \u03b3 = 0.200; also, \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.034, \u03bc = 0.008, \u03bd = 0.015, \u03bb = 0.08 and \u03c1 = \u03ba = \u03be = \u03c3 = 0.017. Hence, the new basic reproduction number becomes R0 = 1.60. After day 28, the lockdown is fully operational and gets stricter (working is no longer a good reason for going out: gradually, non-indispensable activities are stopped): we get \u03b1 = 0.210 and \u03b3 = 0.110, hence R0 = 0.99. After day 38, a wider testing campaign is launched: this yields \u03b5 = 0.200, and also \u03c1 = \u03ba = \u03be = 0.020, while \u03c3 = 0.010 and \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0.025. Therefore, R0 = 0.85. The parameters above were used to simulate the model and generate the graphs reported in Fig. 2. The comparison between the official data and the curves resulting from the SIDARTHE model are provided in Extended Data Fig. 3. The current number of infected (including all stages), the number of recovered and the cumulative number of diagnosed cases are well reproduced, but a small mismatch can be noted in the last days when distinguishing between different SOI. This discrepancy can have two interpretations: on the one hand, the model considers infected with different severities (for example, T(t) is the number of life-threatened patients that would need ICU admission) while the data report the actual treatment that the patients received (for example, the number of patients actually admitted to ICUs, which is constrained by the number of available beds and can be limited if the infected suddenly and quickly worsen, leading to death, before admission to the hospital). Hence, our overestimation of ICU patients may be due to saturation of the healthcare system, which is neglected in the model, or to the sudden worsening of infected who die at home before having the time to reach the ICU. Another possible explanation for our overestimation of patients with symptoms, and life-threatening symptoms, and our underestimation of patients",

Over a 500-day horizon, as shown in infected individuals, the transmission rate and the CFR (the ratio between the Extended Data Fig. 1c, the model predicts an evolution that leads to a peak in number of deaths ascribed to the infection and the number of diagnosed cases). the number of concurrently infected individuals around day 170, amounting The discrepancy between the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the to 11.7% of the population (10.6% of the population have been diagnosed). infection, divided by the total number of people who have been infected) and the Eventually, 35% of the population have contracted the virus (and ~30% have been perceived CFR (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number diagnosed) and ~2.5% of the population have died because of the contagion.

Therefore, the model can explain the possible discrepancy between the reaches its peak on day 198, amounting to 5.3% of the population. The adopted actual infection dynamics and the perception of the phenomenon. Misperception social-distancing policy, although mild, has some impact and helps gain more time (either resulting in underestimating or overestimating) can be particularly relevant to strengthen and supply the healthcare system, but is still insufficient. in the early phases of an epidemic phenomenon due to the lack of thorough Extended Data Fig. 1e,f shows that, with stronger social-distancing information: for example, performing an insufficient number of tests may lead countermeasures, able to yield \u03b1 = 0.200 and \u03b3 = 0.086, hence R0 = 0.787, now lower to underestimating the transmission rate (because many infected subjects are not than 1, the peak is not delayed, but anticipated, because the increase in the number diagnosed as such) and overestimating the CFR (because critical or fatal cases of new infected is reduced so much that it soon becomes a decrease. Over a 300-day hardly go undetected). The model thus provides a rough quantification of the horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e, the model predicts an evolution of the error in estimating the actual number of infected people due to the lack of proper situation that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected individuals diagnostic tests, or due to insufficient number of diagnostic tests being performed. around day 50, amounting to 0.092% of the population; the peak in diagnosed Also, it can explain and predict the long-term effects of underdiagnosis, including infected occurs at day 54 and amounts to 0.083% of the population.

To illustrate the effect of changing the parameter values in the model, our sensitivity analysis results are reported in Extended Data Figs. 4\u201310.

        "content": "Discussion of the model features. The key feature of our proposed model is the distinction between detected and undetected infection cases, and between cases with different SOI classifications (mild and moderate versus major and extreme). Distinguishing between diagnosed and not diagnosed cases allows us to highlight the perceived distortion in disease statistics, such as the number of infected individuals, the transmission rate and the CFR (the ratio between the number of deaths ascribed to the infection and the number of diagnosed cases). The discrepancy between the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the infection, divided by the total number of people who have been infected) and the perceived CFR (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number of people who have been diagnosed as infected) can be quantified based on this model. Therefore, the model can explain the possible discrepancy between the actual infection dynamics and the perception of the phenomenon. Misperception (either resulting in underestimating or overestimating) can be particularly relevant in the early phases of an epidemic phenomenon due to the lack of thorough information: for example, performing an insufficient number of tests may lead to underestimating the transmission rate (because many infected subjects are not diagnosed as such) and overestimating the CFR (because critical or fatal cases hardly go undetected). The model thus provides a rough quantification of the error in estimating the actual number of infected people due to the lack of proper diagnostic tests, or due to insufficient number of diagnostic tests being performed. Also, it can explain and predict the long-term effects of underdiagnosis, including the (apparently surprising) increased number of infections and fatalities, with sudden outbreaks after long silent periods. Once the model parameters have been estimated on the basis of the available clinical data, the model enables us to reproduce and predict the dynamic evolution of the epidemic and to evaluate the possible underestimation or overestimation of the epidemic phenomenon based on current statistics, which are heavily subject to bias (for example, asymptomatic patients may get tested according to some protocols, not tested according to others). The model helps evaluate and predict the effect of the implementation of different guidelines and protocols (for example, more extensive screening for the disease or stricter social-distancing measures), which typically results in a change in the model parameters. The model predictions in the long run are not very sensitive to the initial conditions, but they are sensitive to the parameter values (and in particular extremely sensitive to some of these, as our sensitivity analysis has indicated), which are deeply uncertain and can vary due to several factors, such as population density, cultural habits, environmental conditions and age distribution of the population. The predictions must also consider parameter variations due to the measures imposed by the government. This is a fundamental aspect: in the long term, not imposing drastic measures leads to catastrophic outcomes, even when the initially affected population is a small fraction. Social-distancing measures are modeled by reducing the infection coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. The infection peak time is not monotonic with increasing restrictions. Partial restrictions on population movements postpone the peak, while strong restrictions anticipate the peak. Mild containment measures may have negative effects, for example augmenting the fraction of the population with life-threatening symptoms with respect to the fraction of population with mild symptoms. Diagnosis campaigns can reduce the infection peak, because the diagnosed population enters quarantine and hence is less likely to affect the susceptible population.",

Epidemic evolution that would have been predicted by the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy if, after day 22, social-distancing countermeasures had been: absent (panels a and b), mild (panels c and d), strong (panels e and f) and very strong (panels g and h). In all cases, the actual Case Fatality Rate is around 7.2%, while the perceived CFR is around 9.0%. Panels (a), (c), (e), (g) show the difference between the actual (real cases) and the perceived (diagnosed cases) evolution of the epidemics, while panels (b), (d), (f), (h) distinguish between the different categories of infected patients. Note the different scales between the panels, having different orders of magnitude, which testify the enormous impact of social-distancing and lockdown.",

Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of introducing lack of immunity (hence, the possibility of reinfection) after day 50: recovered individuals can become susceptible again, so we add a term +\u03c7H(t) in equation (1) and a term \u2212\u03c7H(t) in equation (7), where \u03c7 represents the rate at which immunity is lost. We show the evolution of the various model variables when \u03c7\u2009=\u20090, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.1, \u03c7\u2009=\u20090.8. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases, panel (b) in the number of recovered individuals (green) and deaths (black), panel (c) in the total number of currently infected individuals, panels (d)\u2013(h) in the number of infected in different categories. Apart from the number of recovered individuals, which is drastically reduced after loss of immunity, all the other curves are essentially unaffected: the increase in the number of infected and deaths, hence the increase in the number of cumulative infected, is hardly visible.",

Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying the transmission coefficient \u03b1, whose nominal value is \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.21, after day 50. We multiply the nominal value of \u03b1 by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.1, and 1.2, and show the corresponding evolution of the model variables. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases, panel (b) in the number of recovered individuals (green) and deaths (black), panel (c) in the total number of currently infected individuals, panels (d)\u2013(h) in the number of infected in different categories. Increasing \u03b1 significantly increases all the curves: the model is extremely sensitive to variations in the value of \u03b1.",

We multiply the nominal value of \u03b3 by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, and show the corresponding evolution of the model variables. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases, panel (b) in the number of recovered individuals (green) and deaths (black), panel (c) in the total number of currently infected individuals, panels (d)\u2013(h) in the number of infected in different categories.

Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying the transmission coefficient \u03b4, whose nominal value is \u03b4\u2009=\u20090.0050, after day 50. We multiply the nominal value of \u03b4 by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, and show the corresponding evolution of the model variables. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases, panel (b) in the number of recovered individuals (green) and deaths (black), panel (c) in the total number of currently infected individuals, panels (d)\u2013(h) in the number of infected in different categories. Increasing \u03b4 increases all the curves, although the sensitivity is smaller than with respect to \u03b1.",

Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying the testing coefficient \u03b5, whose nominal value is \u03b5\u2009=\u20090.2000, after day 50. We multiply the nominal value of \u03b5 by 0.75, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, and show the corresponding evolution of the model variables. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases, panel (b) in the number of recovered individuals (green) and deaths (black), panel (c) in the total number of currently infected individuals, panels (d)\u2013(h) in the number of infected in different categories. Increasing \u03b5 significantly decreases all the curves: the model is extremely sensitive to variations in the value of \u03b5.",

Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying the testing coefficient \u03b8, whose nominal value is \u03b8\u2009=\u20090.3705, after day 50. We multiply the nominal value of \u03b8 by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, and show the corresponding evolution of the model variables. Panel (a) shows the variation in the total number of cases, panel (b) in the number of recovered individuals (green) and deaths (black), panel (c) in the total number of currently infected individuals, panels (d)\u2013(h) in the number of infected in different categories. Increasing \u03b8 decreases all the curves, but the sensitivity is smaller than with respect to \u03b5.",

Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying, after day 50: the worsening coefficients \u03b6 and \u03b7 leading to clinically relevant symptoms, whose nominal values are \u03b6\u2009=\u2009\u03b7\u2009=\u20090.0250 (row a); the worsening coefficients \u03bc and \u03bd leading to life-threatening symptoms, whose nominal values are \u03bc\u2009=\u20090.0080 and \u03bd = 0.0150 (row b); the healing coefficient \u03bb, whose nominal value is \u03bb\u2009=\u20090.0800 (row c); the healing coefficients \u03c1, \u03ba, \u03be and \u03c3, whose nominal values are \u03c1 = \u03ba = \u03be = 0.0200 and \u03c3 = 0.0100 (row d); the mortality coefficient \u03c4, whose nominal value is \u03c4 = 0.0100 (row e). In all cases, the nominal value of all the considered parameters is multiplied by 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, and the corresponding evolution of the model variables is shown. Increasing \u03b6 and \u03b7 decreases the final number of infected and recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number of symptomatic and life-threatening infections initially increases, to decrease afterwards. Increasing \u03bc and \u03bd decreases the final number of infected and recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number of life-threatening infections initially increases, to decrease afterwards. Increasing \u03bb, as well as the other healing parameters, decreases all the curves, apart from the curve of recovered patients, which initially increases (due to a higher recovery rate) and then eventually decreases (due to less infections overall). Increasing \u03c4 leaves all the curves almost unaffected, apart from the curve of life-threatened infected that is decreased, leading to a small decrease in the curve of all infected cases, the curve of recovered that is decreased and the curve of deaths that is increased.",

A description of all covariates tested A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals) For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted Give P values as exact values whenever suitable. For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.",
